                    <h2>Port of Djupvik</h2>
                    <p>The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close to the beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the port is a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer, comes to life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz.</p>
                    <p>Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupvik Hotel, with modern standard and with its own popular restaurant.</p>
                    <p>Both the port and the fishing village have a beautiful view of two popular bird islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”.</p>
                    <p>The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly beautiful and invites to nice scenery and views on foot, by bike or by car.</p>
                    <p>North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is well soothed for a nice swim.</p>
                    <p>The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles and it is about twice as long to Stora Karlsö (4nm).</p>
